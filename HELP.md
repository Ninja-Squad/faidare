You can find data by building your own query using the fields available in the two tabs of the form:
* The `Germplasm` tab allow you to add criteria on plant material/germplasm (_e.g._ its name, genus or species).
* The `Trait` tab allow you to add criteria on trait(s) and/or variable(s) name(s).

In each field, one or several term(s) can be entered.
As you begin to type, a list of relevant suggestions is proposed to guide you in your search.

The query is launched as soon as at least one parameter is selected in the form.
The results are automatically updated if a parameter is added or removed.

To refine your search, you can add more specific filters by using the facets/categories on the left side.
> Note: applying several filters in the same facet/category will search for documents related to any of the selected terms (resulting in a `OR` operator between all the category's terms).
> In contrary, applying filters in different facets/categories will search for documents having both filters (resulting in an `AND` operator for the different facets).
